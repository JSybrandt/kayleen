We are all so lucky to have had Kayleen in our lives. She was the absolute best
grandmother any person could ever have.

She always wanted Justin, JoJo and I to have magical, innocent lives. Whenever
we played a game, we would play the “Kayleen Way” so us kids (mostly Joseph)
would always win the game and never lose that joy and excitement of playing a
game with your family. One Christmas, Kayleen got me a double stroller for my
twin Biddie Baby Baby Dolls, and she saw that Joseph wanted to play with it too,
so she went and bought him his own stroller so he could join in the fun with me
and we wouldn’t have to share.

Kayleen always found a way to fill our lives with love and happiness. I have the
fondest memories of playing dolls with her as a child, her teaching me all about
paper dolls and us playing with the themed dolls of whatever movie we watched
recently, going to movies with her as I got older, crafting with her in her
stamping/dining room, having her watch me roller skate outside on the warm
summer days, talking about all of my summer reading books (her favorite was
catcher in the rye), and hearing all of her hilarious stories she would tell
about her growing up with Aunt Janny.

This is such a devastating loss for so many of us because Kayleen was such a
wonderful, special person in our lives. We are all so blessed that she was able
to be here with us for as long as she did. And although we will feel this loss
every day, we know that she is now in a better place, reunited with some of our
family she has missed so much for so long.
