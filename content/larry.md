When I was growing up, I always knew my mom was the cool mom.  In the early 80s
she was into newwave music like Romeo Void and Classix Nouveaux.  I had no idea
about that music.  But I listened and still listen to it to this day.  And she
had Neil Diamond and Elton John records that I would play all the time.  I was
exposed to so many things that helped shape me.  She had a weird crush on
William Shatner which probably started my journey into Sci-fi with Star Trek.
She always told me she gave birth to me on September 8th, 1966 when Star Trek
premiered.  Literally when it was on the TV in the hospital room.
