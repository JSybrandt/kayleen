By: Justin Sybrandt
My best memories are of playing games with Kayleen as a kid. While we were young, she would frequently come to watch my siblings and me. Our time was filled with board games, cards, paperdolls, and the stories the four of us would make together. I like to think that these are some of her best memories too. Artifacts of our time stayed on display for over two decades, from crayon drawings still on the walls to a lego robot perched on her windowsill.</description></item></channel></rss>
