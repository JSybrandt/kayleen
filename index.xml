She was the absolute best grandmother any person could ever have.
She always wanted Justin, JoJo and I to have magical, innocent lives. Whenever we played a game, we would play the “Kayleen Way” so us kids (mostly Joseph) would always win the game and never lose that joy and excitement of playing a game with your family. One Christmas, Kayleen got me a double stroller for my twin Biddie Baby Baby Dolls, and she saw that Joseph wanted to play with it too, so she went and bought him his own stroller so he could join in the fun with me and we wouldn’t have to share.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://sybrandt.com/kayleen/larry/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sybrandt.com/kayleen/larry/</guid><description>When I was growing up, I always knew my mom was the cool mom. In the early 80s she was into newwave music like Romeo Void and Classix Nouveaux. I had no idea about that music. But I listened and still listen to it to this day. And she had Neil Diamond and Elton John records that I would play all the time. I was exposed to so many things that helped shape me.</description></item></channel></rss>
